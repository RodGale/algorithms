# Analysis of Algorithms

## Why?

* Predict Performance
* Compare Algorithms
* Provide guarantees
* Understand theoritical basis
* Avoid performance bugs

## Observations

* Measuring the running time
    - Manual/Stopwatch
    - Empirical Analysis - run program for various input sizes and measure running time
    - Data Analysis - Standard plot. Log-log plot, Regression
    - Mathematical models 
        * Total running time = sum of cost * frequency for all operations
    - Theory of Algorithms
       * Tilde - for approximate model
       * Big theta - used for algorithm comparisions
       * Big Oh - used for upper bounds
       * Big Omega - used for lower bounds
       
* Memory
